# Crime stuff
![Graph 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoItaly/social-data-website/refs/heads/main/crime-proportions.png)

In the graph above, we observe the proportion of all crimes committed which were drug/narcotic offenses. California Prop 47 goes thruough in 2014, as annotated, leading to less police enforcement on drug and narcotics offenses, as shown evidently in the graph. while there is a larger trend before 2014 of less drug/narcotic incidents reported, it would be negligent to not include this very important change in the law as contributing to at the very least the continuation of this trend. In 2017, Fentanyl arrives in San Francisco and starts to proliferate through the community, explaining the spike from 2017 to 2018. The other large spike can be seen when the new district attourney entered office in 2022. At this point fentanyl was ravaging communities, and became a larger voter issue. As such they New District Attourney wanted to crack down on fentanyl, which raised police's likelihood of having incidents which involved people who did or had consumed fentanyl, or were in possession of fentanyl. This crisis has gotten so bad that the Mayor has declared a state of emergency due to the drug's impact just last month [2]. This will have ramifications for the amount oy money that different departments within the police department get, as well as the general culture of San Francisco police in terms of which offenses they prioritize.
